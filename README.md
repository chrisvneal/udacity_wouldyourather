# Would You Rather?

## Project details

I built this project while learning _React and React Native_ at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019). What an amazing opportunity! _Would You Rather?_ was one of our first projects and I learned a lot from building it pretty much from the ground up. A database and API were provided for accessing the data.

_Would You Rather?_ allows the user to answer polls, each poll having two options. The user is also able to create his own poll and answer other polls.

See how creative you can be - create a poll and compare your answers with friends!

- choose between 3 views: Unanswered, Answered, All
- **Create** your own poll!
- Check the **Leader Board** for up-to-date user stats

### Tools used

The meat of this project was built using the **React** library; however, I expanded the ecosystem using tools like

- Redux - _for managing application state_
- react-redux - _for simplifying React and Redux state bindings_
- React Router - _helps manage page navigations_
- [Semantic UI CSS library](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) - _to help build out UI components_

Next, type `npm start` to start the application in your default browser.

## Experience

The project got really intense for me when dealing with state updates and understanding **React Router**. I found myself researching quite a bit of material that wasn't directly taught in the course. There was a lot of _ES6_ I needed to brush up on was all.

Overall, it was an enjoyable learning experience and I know a lot more about the React ecosystem than when I started. I'm confident enough to start building my own React projects now!
